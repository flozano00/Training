The Syntax

## function name(type){};  //The function only takes one parameter and for the most part takes care of the portion within Netsuite.

## Difference between **Not Scheduled** & **Scheduled**
The importance of Not Scheduled is the ability to execute at a one time basis. The Not Scheduled portion will allow you to execute

The importance of Scheduled scripts gives you the ability to create a queue and have scripts running on the set time.
