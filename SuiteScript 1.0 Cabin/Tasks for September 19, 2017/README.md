*1.*	Write a script to automatically create a custom record based on sales order save. The custom record must have basic fields from sales order like item, customer name, date etc.  Once the sales order is saved, the related custom record should have all the necessary fields populated from the sales order.
*2.*	Create 3 custom column date fields on the line level of Purchase orders. There needs to be a 4th date field on the line level of the PO which should take the maximum of the other 3 date fields and store the value in the 4th date field while adding a line item on the PO.
